   How to install NEVESIM ?
=============================

NEVESIM can be installed from sources under Linux and under Windows by using the MingGW-w64 toolset.
Here we provide instructions how to install it on Linux. Installations instructions for Windows will be prepared soon. 


=================================================
   Installing the NEVESIM dependencies on Linux
=================================================


NEVESIM depends on the following linux packages, with the specified (or perhaps also newer, but not tested) versions:   

Linux Kernel: 3.8.0-19-generic
gcc: (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.7.3-1ubuntu1) 4.7.3
Python: 2.7.4
python-numpy: 1.7.1
cmake: 2.8.10.1
SWIG: 2.0.8
libcppunit-dev: 1.12.1
libboost-all-dev: 1.49.0.1
build-essential: 11.6
python-matplotlib: 1.2.1

The names of the linux packages are taken from repository in the Linux Mint distribution, where 
nevesim was successfully installed. 

Please note compilation of NEVESIM with newer (or older) versions of these packages has not been tested, 
so some incompatibilities could arise if you decide to check other versions.

To install these packages you should execute the following commands:

sudo apt-get install python-dev

sudo apt-get install python-numpy

# the following 2 pkgs are needed only for running the examples
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
sudo apt-get install ipython

sudo apt-get install swig

sudo apt-get install cmake

sudo apt-get install build-essential

sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

sudo apt-get install libcppunit-dev


===========================================
 Compiling and Installing NEVESIM
===========================================

NEVESIM uses the cmake tool for compiling. 
CMake requires that one creates a separate directory, apart from the project directory, where the building takes place:
 
mkdir _build
cd _build/

If you want to install NEVESIM at a default location, then you should just execute:

cmake ..

If you want to install it at a specific custom location <install_location>, then execute:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_location> ..

This prepares the Make files for compiling NEVESIM. To compile the sources run:

make all

If you want to run the tests, then after the compilation execute:

make check

For generating the doxygen documentation the command is:

make doc

The actual installation of the compiled libraries is done with:

make install

NOTE: If you install to a default location, cmake might put the NEVESIM Python packages in the directory
      "usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages", whereas in your Linux distribution (e.g. Ubuntu, Debian) the default directory 
      for Python packages might be "usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages" or another. Therefore, in this case make sure
      that you set the environment variable PYTHONPATH to this location so that Python can find the NEVESIM python package: 
      export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:${PYTHONPATH}


If you installed NEVESIM at a custom location then you should setup the environment to have access to the NEVESIM 
binary libraries and Python packages:


export NEVESIM_HOME=<install_location>
export PATH=${NEVESIM_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${NEVESIM_HOME}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export PYTHONPATH=${NEVESIM_HOME}/lib/python2.7/site-packages:${PYTHONPATH}

Now you are ready to go!
