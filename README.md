Neural EVEnt-based SIMulator

*NEVESIM* (*N*eural *EVE*nt-based *SIM*ulator) is a software package for event-driven simulation of spiking neural networks. The simulator is written in C++ with a primary interface to Python, intended to be an easily-extendable general purpose tool for event-based neural simulations.

* Additional information including the documentation of the NEVESIM classes can be found here: https://github.com/IGITUGraz/nevesim.
* On the [wiki](https://github.com/IGITUGraz/nevesim/wiki) we provide some examples that demonstrate the principle usage of NEVESIM through its Python interface.
